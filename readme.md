I got this free template from a website. **While you are not permitted to use template sites**, I want you to learn how to take a non-responsive site and make it responsive.

In this assignment you will make the web page fully responsive using media queries. You are also welcome to help update the outdated design.

## Instructions

1. Fork this repo.
2. Clone your version to your local machine.
3. Do not edit the HTML, only the CSS.
4. Add media queries to the CSS file to make the page fully-responsive.
5. The design is a little out-dated, help refresh the look.
6. Commit your changes and sync to your Github account.
7. Create a `gh-pages` branch and sync your changes.
8. Grab the link: `https://username.github.io/iron-rush`.
9. [Submit the link before 5:45pm on 10/30](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1xrycQCAv0LnlLZQVPMSv49dsD2bV3GA48Trw7eyUX_4/viewform).
